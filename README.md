# Python programming tutorial

Python is a high-level programming language. That means that it's easy
to learn and work with, so it's a great choice for a first programming
language.

No tutorial is good for everyone. This one is aimed at people with no
programming experience at all or very little programming experience. If
you have programmed a lot in the past using some other language you
probably want to read
[the official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead.

This tutorial was written in Python 3, and you need Python 3 or newer to
be able to run the example code yourself. Python 2 is getting outdated
all the time, and more and more projects are moving to Python 3. There
are a few popular libraries that don't support Python 3 that well at the
time of writing this, but you don't need to worry about that just yet.
They will probably support Python 3 by the time you've learned the
basics and you may actually need them.

I have tested most of the code in this tutorial on Python 3.4, but
everything should also work on Python 3.3, 3.2 and all newer Pythons.

## List of contents

The tutorial consists of two parts. The Basics part will get you started 
with using Python and you'll be able to get things done after studying 
it. If you get interested in learning Python and you want to learn more 
advanced techniques, you can also read the Advanced part.

## How to read this tutorial without an internet connection

1. Go [here](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial) if you aren't
    here already.
2. Click the big green "Clone or download" button in the top right of
    the page, then click "Download ZIP".

3. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more
    specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on
    which operating system you run.
4. Run `make-html.py` and follow the instructions.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the
repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage
with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole
tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to
pull with git and run `make-html.py` again.
